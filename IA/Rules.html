      <h2>Guess The Animal</h2>
      <p>The rules are simple, the player will have 6 guesses to find the correct animal. Any english word can be used in guessing. Once the player has inputed a guess, the tiles will change colours accordingly. Green means that the letter is correct and in the right position. Yellow means the letter is correct but in the wrong position and Gray means it is the wrong letter. Inputting an incorrect word will produce a message and allow you to guess again. </p>
      <h3>Word Association</h3>
      <p>The player will be faced with 5 boxes, each box contains 3 words. The point of the game is to select the word that follows the trend of the 3 above. Aim to get the highest score out of 5 guesses. </p>
      <h4>Word Scrambler</h4>
      <p>The player will have 30 seconds. During this time, they are to decipher the correct word from the scrambled letters provided and input it into the guess box.</p>
